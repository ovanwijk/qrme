# qrme
decentralized IPFS based QRCode download linker.

This is a small library with a single file to create the URL encoding required for an IPFS
based page to react on the visual transfer of QR codes. You are yourself responsible for making the QR code itself.

To support the project please help pinning the exposed app on your IPFS node:
